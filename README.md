In this project i build up my logic to help an elderly person(65+ years old).
The main Innovation and ideation from my side from this project in future to make a app.
And in this app we provide the facility of online order to sit in the home elder person to order the medicine which required to them.
So that they don't go outside form the home and take order to medicine at home.


And here some points to help the elder person to live a healthier and better life:-

Regular internet use has been shown to reduce the risk of dementia because it helps improve cognitive functioning and memory skills. Every time an older adult completes a sudoku puzzle online or crossword online, they're keeping their brain sharp.
Try to encourage some regular physical activity. Walking, physical therapy exercises, even clapping hands to music all stimulate blood flow, relieve stress and anxiety, and encourage heart health. Exercise also improves the quality of sleep, builds stamina, and can relieve depression.
In the past several decades, technological advances have opened new possibilities for improving patient safety. Using technology to digitize healthcare processes has the potential to increase standardization and efficiency of clinical workflows and to reduce errors and cost across all healthcare settings.
ThankYou.
